Reporting bugs
--------------

Report all the bugs you can find to us! If something is not quite
working yet, we really want to know. Reporting a bug to us is the best
way to get it fixed quickly, and get our unconditional gratitude.

It is quick, easy, and probably the best way to contribute to Bitmask
development, other than submitting patches.

**Reporting better bugs:** New to bug reporting? Here you have a
[great document about this noble art](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

### Where to report bugs

We use the [Bitmask Bug
Tracker](https://leap.se/code/projects/eip-client), although you can
also use [Github
issues](https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client/issues). But we
reaaaally prefer if you sign up in the former to send your bugs our way.

### What to include in your bug report

-   The symptoms of the bug itself: what went wrong? What items appear
    broken, or do not work as expected? Maybe an UI element that appears
    to freeze?
-   The Bitmask version you are running. You can get it by doing bitmask
    --version, or you can go to Help -\> About Bitmask menu.
-   The installation method you used: bundle? from source code? debian
    package?
-   Your platform version and other details: Ubuntu 12.04? Debian
    unstable? Windows 8? OSX 10.8.4? If relevant, your desktop system
    also (gnome, kde...)
-   When does the bug appear? What actions trigger it? Does it always
    happen, or is it sporadic?
-   The exact error message, if any.
-   Attachments of the log files, if possible (see section below).

Also, try not to mix several issues in your bug report. If you are
finding several problems, it's better to issue a separate bug report for
each one of them.

### Attaching log files

If you can spend a little time getting them, please add some logs to the
bug report. They are **really** useful when it comes to debug a problem.
To do it:

Launch Bitmask in debug mode. Logs are way more verbose that way:

    bitmask --debug

Get your hand on the logs. You can achieve that either by clicking on
the "Show log" button, and saving to file, or directly by specifying the
path to the logfile in the command line invocation:

    bitmask --debug --logfile /tmp/bitmask.log

Attach the logfile to your bug report.

### Need human interaction?

You can also find us in the `#leap` channel on the [freenode
network](https://freenode.net). If you do not have a IRC client at hand,
you can [enter the channel via
web](http://webchat.freenode.net/?nick=leaper....&channels=%23leap&uio=d4).

Fetching latest development code
--------------------------------

Normally, testing the latest client bundles should be enough. We are engaged
in a three-week release cycle with minor releases that are as stable as
possible.

However, if you want to test that some issue has *really* been fixed
before the next release is out (if you are testing a new provider, for
instance), you are encouraged to try out the latest in the development
branch. If you do not know how to do that, or you prefer an automated
script, keep reading for a way to painlessly fetch the latest
development code.

We have put together a script to allow rapid testing in different
platforms for the brave souls like you. Check it out in the
*Using automagic helper script* section of the
[Hacking](client/dev-environment) page only that in a more compact
way suitable (ahem) also for non developers.

> **note**
>
> At some point in the near future, we will be using standalone bundles
> \<standalone-bundle\> with the ability to self-update.

### Local config files

If you want to start fresh without config files, just move them. In
linux:

    mv ~/.config/leap ~/.config/leap.old

### Testing the packages

When we have a release candidate for the supported platforms, we will
announce also the URI where you can download the rc for testing in your
system. Stay tuned!

Testing the status of translations
----------------------------------

We need translators! You can go to
[transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitmask/), get an
account and start contributing.

If you want to check the current status of bitmask localization in a
language other than the one set in your machine, you can do it with a
simple trick (under linux). For instance, do:

    $ lang=es_ES bitmask

for running Bitmask with the spanish locales.
