This document covers how to launch Bitmask. Also know as, where the
magic happens.

Launching Bitmask
-----------------

After a successful installation, there should be a launcher called
bitmask somewhere in your path:

    % bitmask

The first time you launch it, it should launch the first run wizard that
will guide you through the mostly automatic configuration of the LEAP
Services.

> **note**
>
> You will need to enter a valid test provider running the LEAP
> Platform. You can use the LEAP test service, *<https://bitmask.net>*

Debug mode
----------

If you are happy having lots of output in your terminal, you will like
to know that you can run bitmask in debug mode:

    $ bitmask --debug

If you ask for it, you can also have all that debug info in a beautiful
file ready to be attached to your bug reports:

    $ bitmask --debug --logfile /tmp/leap.log

I want all the options!
-----------------------

To see all the available command line options:

    $ bitmask --help
