- @title = "Source Code"
- @summary = "Overview of the main code repositories"

%p This page should give an easy overview of the most important repositories. The authorative code is hosted at #{link 'leap.se/git' => 'https://leap.se/git/'}, but they are also mirrored to #{link 'github' => 'https://github.com/leapcode/'}.

%p In general, all LEAP code repositories will have <code>develop</code> and <code>master</code> branches. The <code>master</code> branch should be a stable, release version of the software. The <code>develop</code> branch is where all feature and bugfix branches are merged into.
